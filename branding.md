## Hook Style Rules

1. **Tone**: Energetic and conversational—speak directly to the viewer like you're sharing a secret with a friend. Avoid formal or educational language.

2. **Length**: Keep hooks under 12 words. Get to the point immediately—attention spans are short.

3. **Emotional Words**: Always include one power word (craziest, wildest, cutest, deadliest, unbelievable, shocking) to trigger curiosity and encourage viewers to watch until the end.

## Thumbnail & Visual Rules

1. **Subject Focus**: Use close-up, high-quality images of the animal's face or most distinctive feature. The animal should fill at least 60% of the frame—no wide landscape shots.

2. **Color & Contrast**: Prefer images with vibrant, natural colors and strong contrast. Avoid dark, blurry, or low-resolution photos that won't pop on mobile screens.

3. **Simplicity**: One animal per image. No cluttered backgrounds, text overlays, or busy compositions. Let the animal be the star—the curiosity gap is in the facts, not the thumbnail.
